# Translator App Development TODO

- [x] Create project directory: translator-app
- [x] Create index.html with basic structure (textarea for input, div for output, buttons for start/stop translation, language selection dropdown)
- [x] Create styles.css for responsive design (mobile-friendly, modern UI with gradients and animations)
- [x] Create script.js with:
  - Speech recognition setup
  - Function to call MyMemory translation API
  - Speech synthesis for output
  - Event listeners for buttons
- [x] Repositioned Translate button between input and output sections, added language switch button with arrows, made text boxes complete rectangles
- [x] Integrated LibreTranslate API for accurate, AI-powered translations across multiple languages including Indian and major foreign languages
- [x] Test the app using browser_action to launch and verify functionality (voice input, translation, voice output)
